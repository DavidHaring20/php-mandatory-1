get_fake_full_name_and_gender()
    This method extracts the person from person-names.json file. Firstly, whole file is read into one variable. That variable is decoded using json_decode() method
    and by providing "true" parameter, returned is associative array. Since there is array in array, we extract needed array. Next we pick random person by using rand()
    method. As minimum parameter we give 0 as arrays in PHP start with 0 and as maximum parameter we give total size of the array but deducted by 1. We are then given the
    associative array presenting one person.
