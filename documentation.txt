get_fake_cpr_number() 
    This method creates random CPR number by taking 4 different numbers randomly generated numbers. First is days, second is months, third is year and fourth 
    is random sequence of numbers. They are automatically parsed to String with strval() method and if they lack some digits, padded with str_pad() method.

get_fake_full_name_and_gender()
    This method extracts the person from person-names.json file. Firstly, whole file is read into one variable. That variable is decoded using json_decode() method
    and by providing "true" parameter, returned is associative array. Since there is array in array, we extract needed array. Next we pick random person by using rand()
    method. As minimum parameter we give 0 as arrays in PHP start with 0 and as maximum parameter we give total size of the array but deducted by 1. We are then given the
    associative array presenting one person. 

get_fake_full_name_gender_and_date_of_birth()
    This method uses get_fake_full_name_and_gender() method from above to generate fullname and gender. Date of birth is generates similarly as in get_fake_cpr_number() method
    just the number for the years go from 1900 (minimum) to 2022 (maximum). Also the str_pad() method in $yy variable is obsolete and therefore removed.
