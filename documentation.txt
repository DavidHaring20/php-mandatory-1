get_fake_cpr_number() 
    This method creates random CPR number by taking 4 different numbers randomly generated numbers. First is days, second is months, third is year and fourth 
    is random sequence of numbers. They are automatically parsed to String with strval() method and if they lack some digits, padded with str_pad() method.

get_fake_full_name_and_gender()
    This method extracts the person from person-names.json file. Firstly, whole file is read into one variable. That variable is decoded using json_decode() method
    and by providing "true" parameter, returned is associative array. Since there is array in array, we extract needed array. Next we pick random person by using rand()
    method. As minimum parameter we give 0 as arrays in PHP start with 0 and as maximum parameter we give total size of the array but deducted by 1. We are then given the
    associative array presenting one person. 

get_fake_full_name_gender_and_date_of_birth()
    This method uses get_fake_full_name_and_gender() method from above to generate fullname and gender. Date of birth is generates similarly as in get_fake_cpr_number() method
    just the number for the years go from 1900 (minimum) to 2022 (maximum). Also the str_pad() method in $yy variable is obsolete and therefore removed.

get_fake_cpr_number_full_name_and_gender()
    This method extracts the person from person-names.json file. Firstly, whole file is read into one variable. That variable is decoded using json_decode() method
    and by providing "true" parameter, returned is associative array. Since there is array in array, we extract needed array. Next we pick random person by using rand()
    method. As minimum parameter we give 0 as arrays in PHP start with 0 and as maximum parameter we give total size of the array but deducted by 1. We are then given the
    associative array presenting one person. We take that array to form full name and gender of a person. Next we generate day, month and year for cpr number. Depending on 
    the sex of the person either odd or even number is generated.

get_fake_cpr_number_full_name_gender_and_date_of_birth()
    This method extracts the person from person-names.json file. Firstly, whole file is read into one variable. That variable is decoded using json_decode() method
    and by providing "true" parameter, returned is associative array. Since there is array in array, we extract needed array. Next we pick random person by using rand()
    method. As minimum parameter we give 0 as arrays in PHP start with 0 and as maximum parameter we give total size of the array but deducted by 1. We are then given the
    associative array presenting one person. We take that array to form full name and gender of a person. Next we generate day, month and year for cpr number. 
    Year is generated in yyyy format and not in yy format as before. Therefore substr() method is used to have to different formats needed. Depending on the sex of the person 
    either odd or even number is generated for the end of CPR number.

get_fake_address()
    This method returns full fake address. Street name is generated randomly from provided characters. Number is randomly generated. Floor is by default "st", bt there is added 
    simple logic that either let's it be "st" or changes to some other floor - number between 1 and 99. Door is by default "th". By adding simple logic it can either be "tv", "mf", 
    a number between 1 and 50 or a String consisting of lowercase letter, an optional dash and 1 to 3 digits. Postal code and town are extracted from postal-codes.json file.

get_fake_mobile_phone_number()
    This method returns 8 digit mobile phone number. A json file called phone-number-digit-combinations.json has been created inside data folder where all the possible starting digit 
    combinations have been defined. This method takes random digit combination and fills the rest with random integers.

get_fake_person()
get_fake_persons()
    These methods combine get_fake_cpr_number_full_name_gender_and_date_of_birth(), get_fake_address() and get_fake_mobile_phone_number() methods to generate fake person/s. In latter can the number of 
    required persons be specified. That number however, must be between 2 and 100.
